- text: Electric Mavericks were great! Really easy to communicate with prior to our event, helpful and happy to make our requests work. On they day just got on with setting up and sound check smoothly, with minimal input from us, leaving us to continue enjoying our wedding. Having a band play at our garden wedding was really special, and the guys were perfect. They were fun, and every song sounded great. We have recommended them to friends and would definitely hope to get them back if we have another excuse for a garden party! Having a band on our patio and dancing on our lawn under fairy lights was dreamy. Thanks guys!
