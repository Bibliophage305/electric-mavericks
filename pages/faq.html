        <div class="row">
          <p>
            We bring our standard PA and lights to every show at no extra cost.
            If you already have a suitable sound system we're happy to use it,
            but if you don't, then you don't need to hire any extra equipment
            for us.

          <p>
            We usually play for a total of two hours, split into two hour-long
            sets. We also offer an extra hour-long acoustic set, ideal for a
            drinks reception or cocktail hour.

            Anything you like! We can play pre-mixed playlists - either ours or
            something you send us in advance - or hand over to your DJ. We also
            offer a DJ upgrade, where a band member will select and mix tracks
            as well as take requests.

            So long you can provide power (and a plan B in case of inclement
            weather), we can play anywhere you'd like us.

            We play a lot around the South of England, but we often travel much
            further afield. We're happy to put together a quote to play anywhere
            in the UK (or the world!)

            We prefer to have 90 minutes between the earliest time we can have

            Yes! Get in touch with us and we'll work with you to build a bespoke

            We are happy to perform one special request for you - for weddings
            this is usually the first dance. You can also let us know your top
            10 preferences from our repertoire, as well as send up to 30
            requests for the disco, so you can be sure to hear all your
            favourites on the evening.

            We're highly experienced in dealing with noise limiters, and we
            usually don't have a problem with them. That said we are a loud rock
            band so please put us in contact with your venue and we'll make sure
            we have all of the relevant information to plan around it.
