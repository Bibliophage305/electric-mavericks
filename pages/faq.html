          <p>
            We bring our standard PA and lights to every show at no extra cost.
            If you already have a suitable sound system we're happy to use it,
            but if you don't, then you don't need to hire any extra equipment
            for us.

            We usually play for a total of two hours, split into two hour-long
            sets. We also offer an extra hour-long acoustic set, ideal for a
            drinks reception or cocktail hour.

            Anything you like! We can play pre-mixed playlists - either ours or
            something you send us in advance - or hand over to your DJ. We also
            offer a DJ upgrade, where a band member will select and mix tracks
            as well as take requests.

            So long you can provide power (and a plan B in case of inclement

            We play a lot around the South of England, but we often travel much
            further afield. We're happy to put together a quote to play anywhere
            in the UK (or the world!)

            We prefer to have 90 minutes between the earliest time we can have

            Yes! Get in touch with us and we'll work with you to build a bespoke
            package, including acoustic solo, duo, or trio sets.

            What is the difference between the 'pre-mixed DJ service' that comes
            with the standard package and the 'band member to DJ live' which is
            an optional extra?
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            The pre-mixed DJ service is where the band put on a bespoke playlist
            (you can request up to 30 songs in advance for this) through the PA
            before and after their live sets. We do this at most events and it
            works great - the volume of the music would be the same as if you
            had a DJ.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you upgrade to the live DJ service, you can still send over
            preferences in advance, but you will also have a band member
            selecting and mixing tracks live on the night, as well as taking
            requests. The DJ will be happy to make important announcements but
            they will not talk constantly over or between tracks (that's just
            not our style!). We also think it's important to say that the DJ
            won't have a separate DJ booth - they will set up in an appropriate
            space (ideally to the side of the stage) and the PA/lighting will be
            the same as what is being used by the band.

            We are happy to perform one special request for you - for weddings
            this is usually the first dance. You can also let us know your top
            10 preferences from our repertoire, as well as send up to 30
            requests for the disco, so you can be sure to hear all your
            favourites on the evening.

            We're highly experienced in dealing with noise limiters, and we

            band so please put us in contact with your venue and we'll make sure
            we have all of the relevant information to plan around it.
